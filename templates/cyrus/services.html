							<blockquote class="generic-blockquote">
								As an MFI, CYRUS was formed with the purpose of providing social and financial solutions to the poor. To determine its vulnerability to credit risk, there is review of the policies and procedures at every stage in the lending process to determine whether they reduce delinquencies and loan losses to an acceptable level. These policies and procedures include the loan eligibility criteria, the application review process and authorization levels, collateral or security requirements, as well as the “carrots and sticks” used to motivate staff and compel borrowers to repay.

							<blockquote class="generic-blockquote">
								The screening process ensures that the applicants are micro borrowers. CYRUS caters for low-income clients, both the underemployed and the entrepreneurs with an often informal family business (eg petty traders, vegetable farmers etc). Borrowers are typically concentrated in a limited geographic area, social segment or entrepreneurial undertakings. Loans are very small, short term, and unsecured, with more frequent repayments. The applicants are made to understand that the loans are purely for business and not for personal purposes such as school fees, funeral expenses. They are also made to understand if a borrower defaults, the other members in the group become liable hence the importance of keeping a cohesive group

The borrower’s character and willingness to repay is also assessed during field visits. Since credit bureau data are not available for low-income clients a labour-intensive approaches to credit analysis is used.

								Applicants whose loans have been approved are then trained in Basic Financial Management. They are trained to distinguish between working capital and profit, in basic customer service and to inculcate in them the habit of savings. Elementary book keeping is not mandatory since most of them cannot read and write. CYRUS does not request for separate fees for processing of transactions particularly in relation to administrative costs involved in visitation and monitoring of loans.

								<h4 class="mb-20">Use of collateral</h4>
								<p>CYRUS borrowers lack collateral traditionally required by banks, and hence social collateral is used as leverage to induce payment. In this case, underwriting depends on a labour-intensive analysis of the household’s repayment capacity and the borrower’s character. A group is typically made of 5 members who are comfortable with each other (borrowers actually form the groups themselves). The details of each group member are captured in CYRUS’ information system. Interest on loans is between 1% - 5% per month for a period of 4 months or 6 months. Each group has its unique ID</p>

						<div class="col-md-4">
							<div class="single-defination">
								<h4 class="mb-20">Progressively increasing lending</h4>
								<p>CYRUS customers have limited access to other financing and are dependent upon ongoing access to CYRUS’ credit. CYRUS uses incentive schemes to reward good borrowers with preferential access to future, larger loans. The cap for first cycle loans is GHS 300.00 per individual in a group of 5. A group is graduated to the second cycle after a successful repayment at the first cycle.  The cap for the second cycle is GHS 500.00 per individual for a period of six months</p>
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="col-md-4">
							<div class="single-defination">
								<h4 class="mb-20">Controlling arrears</h4>
								<p>Strict control of arrears is employed by CYRUS given the short-term nature of the loans, lack of collateral, and high frequency of payments (eg weekly or bi-weekly). Monitoring is primarily in the hands of loan officers as the knowledge of the client’s personal circumstances is important for effective collections</p>
